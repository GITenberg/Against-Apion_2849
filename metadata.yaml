description: This volume contains a fresh English translation of Josephus' apologetic
  treatise 'Against Apion', based on the new textual research conducted by the MÃ¼nster
  Josephus project. It also provides the first English commentary on this treatise,
  with comprehensive treatment of the historical, literary, and rhetorical features
  of Josephus' most engaging literary product. 'Against Apion' contains the most important
  evidence for hostility to Judeans in antiquity, as Josephus responds to both Egyptian
  and Hellenistic slurs on the Judean people, their origins and character. Josephus'
  robust defense of his people, with his striking account of the Judean constitution
  ("theocracy"), also constitutes the finest example of Judean apologetics from antiquity.
